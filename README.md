# Portfolio 2022
## Eliot PORTEVIN
### Under the direction of Mr. Yakhontov
This project was developped in April 2022 in the context of Erg√§nzungsfach Informatik.
The goal was to familiarise oneself with some of the basic concepts of JDK, mainly using
the standard java libraries, as well as [Flanagan's scientific library](https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/index.html).
## Running the project
For IDEs such as IntelliJ, you may simply open the downloaded project folder and run the project.
It should be compiled and run by default.
For BlueJ, the 'src' folder should be opened.

All scripts can be run separately, however Menu.class is meant to count as the
main class.
