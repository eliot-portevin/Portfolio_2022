# Portfolio 2022
## Eliot PORTEVIN
### Under the direction of Mr. Yakhontov
This project was developped in April 2022 in the context of Erg√§nzungsfach Informatik.
The goal was to familiarise oneself with some of the basic concepts of JDK, mainly using
the standard java libraries, as well as [Flanagan's scientific library](https://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/index.html).
## Running the project
For IDEs such as IntelliJ, you may simply open the project folder
containing the 'src' folder. The project will be compiled and run by default.
For BlueJ, the 'src' folder should be opened.
